import * as d3 from 'd3'

// Your code can also go in this file (aside from App.vue), when you have trouble dealing with .vue file extension.
// This file is imported in App.vue .
// If you chose this solution and you want to add DOM Elements to your HTML (like <div> etc.), please do this in ../public/index.html and NOT in App.vue! The App.vue DOM is not ready at the moment when the app.js is imported!

//d3.select('#canvas').style("border", "5px solid gray" )
