## IMPORTANT
Your code can also be pasted in `src/app.js` if you have trouble dealing with `.vue` file extension.
This file is then imported in App.vue .

If you chose this solution and you want to add DOM Elements to your HTML (like `<div>` etc.), please do this in `public/index.html` and NOT in `App.vue`!
